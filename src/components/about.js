        <p class="about-intro">
            Time is not just measured in days and hours, but in the rhythms of the moon, 
            the whispers of the trees, and the unseen magic that connects all things. 
            Welcome to the Lunar Almanacâ€”where ancient wisdom meets celestial wonder.

            <h2>The Lunar Almanac</h2>
            <p>

                leading us through the changing seasons, whispering secrets of transformation and renewal.
